## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis based on a set of health measurements. The dataset used in this project is the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of several health-related attributes:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age**: Age in years
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0 or 1), indicating whether the individual has diabetes (1) or not (0)
## Methodology

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- **Loading the Dataset**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial exploration includes checking for missing values, understanding the distribution of features, and visualizing the data to identify patterns and correlations.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values are handled through various techniques such as mean/median imputation.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardization or normalization of features to bring all attributes to a comparable scale.
- **Splitting Data**: The dataset is split into training and test sets to evaluate the performance of the models.

### 3. Model Development
Several classification algorithms are implemented and evaluated:
- **Logistic Regression**: A linear model for binary classification.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric method used for classification.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A supervised learning model used for classification.
- **Decision Tree**: A non-linear model that splits the data into subsets based on the most significant attributes.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
- **Gradient Boosting**: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially to correct errors of previous models.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: Metrics to evaluate the performance, especially for imbalanced datasets.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix to visualize the performance of the classification models.

### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Grid Search**: A method to find the best combination of hyperparameters for each model to improve performance.

### 6. Model Comparison
- **Comparing Models**: The performance of each model is compared based on evaluation metrics to select the best model for predicting diabetes.

## Results
The final results indicate the performance of each model. The best-performing model is selected based on accuracy and other relevant metrics. The project concludes with insights and potential areas for improvement.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of various classification algorithms to predict diabetes. It highlights the importance of data preprocessing, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning in developing effective predictive models.
